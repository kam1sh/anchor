Frontend
========

Overview
--------

Anchor web interface built on top of both simple and mature elements such as:

* Bootstrap 4 - for styling
* Django Templates - for page templating
* Crispy forms - for automatic styling of HTML forms in templates

UI copied from GitLab. GitLab interface is great
and imitation is the best form of sawder.
